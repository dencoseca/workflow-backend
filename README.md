## Reflection

Now this is the app that blew my mind wide open and made me realise that I want to be a Web Developer for the rest of my career. After learning React by building [Pokemon Type Matcher](https://github.com/dencoSeca/pokemon-type-matcher) and Express, Node and MongoDB by building [Recipe Costings](https://github.com/dencoSeca/recipe-costings) I wanted to build an app with the full MERN stack. My other goal was to learn functional components, Hooks and Context in React. This stack, combined with use-immer to manage app-wide state and dispatches, just made something click in my mind and I became completely obsessed with developing in React. This lead me on to finding Gatsby and graphql and those exciting things.

Building a frontend, backend API and modelling a database and managing data validation and pending server requests really helped me see the kinds of design decisions that are driven by full-stack development. How and where state is stored, how much of my data to call up before it’s needed to improve loading times, and a million other decisions! My other goal was to break away from using bootstrap for every project. Workflow’s CSS is built with Bulma.
